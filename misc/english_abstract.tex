NBIOT technology is a communication technology and protocol for limited devices in the Internet of things, which belong to Low-Power Wide-Area Network technology, and has the advantages of wide coverage, low energy consumption and large number of load connections. It is also used to solve the scenario of massive Machine Type of communication in 5G. Based on BC35G module, this paper discusses NBIOT related communication technologies and module design ideas, and finally demonstrates the development process and experiment in stm32 development board for immobilization control Internet of things application.
